# 3D-Printable-Car-Parts-Database

This project is dedicated to keeping the sports cars we love from the 80's, 90's and early 2000's on the road for many years to come.  There are some amazing performance cars from this era that are still affordable and loads of fun to drive today.  The goal is to pick up where the maufacturer development left off to solve common problems and fill in the gaps for parts that are no longer available.

 Unfortunately this was also an era that introduced a lot of new manufacturing techniques including heavy use of plastics and adheasives that left a lot to be desired in the longevity department.  The future of car restoration is in the ability to work with these newer materials to produce high quality, long lasting parts.
