# 3D-Printable-Car-Parts-Database

I drive a 1995 BMW M3.  It is an amazing car and brings me so much joy to drive.  It's also slowly disintigrating.  30 year old plastic and glue were not made to last.  

This project started as a way to keep my 90's cars on the road and looking nice.  Tinkering around with this stuff is the thing I can't not do.  Maybe you're the same way.  This is a collection of 3d-printable parts, upholstery patterns, and related repair materials for all sorts of cars from this era.  Take what you find here and apply it to make something for your own car.  Share what you learn with your own enthusiast community.

We've entered an era where we don't fix things anymore.  So many things today aren't repairable or are engineered to have a finite life span.  Cars are no different.  There are so many great sports cars the 80's, 90's and early 2000's.  Icons that are still affordable and loads of fun to drive today.  This project is dedicated to the art and craftsmanship of keeping these cars on the road for many more years to come.
