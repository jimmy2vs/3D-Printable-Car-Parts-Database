# Why make this?
On the 1992-1999 BMW e36 3-series cars with the M-TECH front bumper the lower grill mesh is attached to the bumper cover by a series of plastic posts molded into the grill opening and secured by one-way push clips.  Over time these plastic posts fatigue and break off.  The posts are not individually placeable.  The only remedy is to purchase, paint, and install new bumper cover.  This repair kit replaces the plastic posts and one way-nuts with a bonded in theaded insert and screw-in clamp which is far sturdier and makes the lower grill mesh easily relacable in the event of future damage.

## Installation
1. Remove the front bumper and support it nose down on a table or stand.
2. Remove the existing grill mesh by cutting or prying up any remaining push clips.  An interior trim tool can be used to gently work them free.
3. Clean and inspect the bumper cover for any cracks or other damage around the grill opening.  Stop and repair any problem areas before proceeding.
4. Using the photos below as a guide, scuff the area where the upper and lower mounts will be bonded into place.
5. Clean the cuffed areas with alcohol or another suitable adhesive prep.
6. Spread a modest amount of adhesive on the back side of each mounting tab and set in place.  The threaded hole should be fluch, or just slightly below the lip of the grill opening.
7. Allow at least 24 hours for the adhesive to cure.
8. Place the grill mesh insert into the opening and mark the 5 areas to trim. Trim the grill using the dremel tool.
9. Pleasce the grill mesh back into the opening, it should sit flush against the bumper cover now.
10. Screw in the 5 hold downs to secure the grill mesh to the bumper cover.
11. Reinstall the bumper.
